Sobre o autor:
==============

Mark Lutz is the author of Python's foundational and best-selling texts, 
a former trainer with two decades of experience teaching Python to newcomers, and
one of the people responsible for the prominence that Python enjoys today.

Mark is the author of the three O'Reilly books Learning Python, Programming Python, 
and Python Pocket Reference, all currently in fourth or fifth editions. 
He has been using and promoting Python since 1992, started writing Python books in 1995,
 and began teaching Python classes in 1997. As of mid-2018, Mark has:

Taught 260 live and in-person Python classes to roughly 4,000 students, in a training
career that spanned both continents and decades
Written 14 Python books that have sold over 625,000 units, span 11,000 published pages,
cover Pythons 1.X through 3.X, and have been translated to at least a dozen languages
Together, Mark's quarter century of Python efforts so far have helped to establish it as
one of the most widely used programming languages in the world. Though no longer teaching
formal classes today, he continues to advocate improvement in Python, open source, and the
software field at large through his posts, programs, and books.

In addition, Mark has been a software professional for over three decades. He holds BS and
MS degrees in computer science from the University of Wisconsin where he explored 
implementations of the Prolog language, and over his career has worked as a software 
developer on compilers, programming tools, scripting systems, and assorted client/server 
and business applications.
